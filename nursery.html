<h1 class="project-heading">Description</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project was to explore how to convey a simple nursery rhyme, The Farmer in the Dell, through exploring the relationships between typography and graphic element. </p></div>

<h1 class="project-heading">Approach</h1>
<p>The design process began with figuring out how to convey the idea of connection. The story acts as almost on long chain of reactions so I wanted to visually represent linkages throughout the book. The first thing that came to mind was something resembling a family tree. Though it carried out the idea well, design wise I personally was not a fan. Next I thought of how I could use text to connect the words. Again, the idea came across however the hierarchy was lost as the way of reading the text began to get confusing. I began to think of not going the literal meaning route for visual representation and this opened up more possibilities for me. I didn’t have any false constraints and I could experiment more with ideas and graphic compositions.

  <h1 class="project-heading">Challenges</h1>
  <p>As more and more connections were being created, it became more difficult to distinguish one character’s design from another. As a result I wanted to explore the implementation of colour. This colour clarified and gave more personality to each entity. I extended this use of colour into the overall art direction and used it as a means to unify the entire publication as a whole.

      <h1 class="project-heading">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This project allowed me to explore abstract means of graphic design. While I am perfectly comfortable designing within a grid system and with vertical and horizontal lines,  this exploration allowed me to explore and begin practicing abstract art. </p>
