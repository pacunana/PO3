<h1 class="project-heading">Description</h1>
<p>Bushido os a bi-monthly publication that is devoted to highlighting the diverse range of Asian martial arts styles. Each issue focuses in on one style of Asian martial arts. The detailed accounts of each form provides the reader with not only the characteristics of the style, but their unique histories as well. Bushido is a Japanese word that can be broken down into two parts, bushi meaning warrior, and do meaning way — way of the warrior. This term reflects the magazine’s goal to highlight Asian martial arts by going beyond the sport itself and diving deeper into its ability to impact one’s mind, body, and spirit at once. </p>

<h1 class="project-heading">Approach</h1>
<p>Though the topic is Asian martial arts, which is very action packed, Bushido's goal is to showcase how something so physical can be beneficial in a spiritual manner. For this reason, the Bushido logo was created with lowercase letters in the Quadrat Serial typeface to depict a relaxed tone. To juxtapose this feeling, I selected a photograph of Donnie Yen in an action pose for the cover image of the magazine. This was done to capture the fluidity, motion and power that is naturally found in martial arts. Similarly, the accented line over the "o" is also shown with as a fluid line rather than a solid line. For my cover lines and fundamental aspects, I was inspired by Japanese graphic design where their characters are often written vertically. As a result, I changed the orientation of some of the cover and selected a serif font to resemble the strokes of Japanese kanji.

  <h1 class="project-heading">Challenges</h1>
  <p>Due to the nature of the images available, Photoshop was needed to create an image suitable for the magazine. As a result, more space is created to play around with the layout of text on top of the image. In addition, the image had to be treated in order for the text being placed to be more visible in comparison.

      <h1 class="project-heading">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This project allowed me to learn how to create different aspects of a project while still allowing for each part to be unified with another. It also allowed me to learn how to alter images in a seamless manner to create space when a design calls for more space. </p>
